# Load Test Results

> Last Updated: May 22, 2025

## Overview
This document presents the results from a load testing run of the ETL pipeline with GlassFlow. 
The test was conducted to evaluate the performance and reliability of the system under various configurations.

## Test Data
The complete test results are available in the [etl-clickhouse-loadtest](https://github.com/glassflow/clickhouse-etl-loadtest) repository. The results include detailed metrics for each test variant, including throughput, latency, and processing times.

### Test Data Format
The tests were conducted using user event data with the following JSON structure:
```json
{
    "event_id": "$uuid4",
    "user_id": "$uuid4",
    "name": "$name",
    "email": "$email",
    "created_at": "$datetime(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)"
}
```

### Test Scope
These load tests focused specifically on the deduplication functionality of GlassFlow. The tests did not include temporal joins. Each test run:
- Generated events with the above schema
- Applied deduplication based on event_id
- Measured performance metrics for the deduplication process

## Discussion
We encourage discussion and feedback on these results. Please join the conversation in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/glassflow/discussions) where you can:
- Share your observations
- Ask questions about the test methodology
- Discuss potential optimizations
- Compare results with your own testing

## Key Findings

### Stability
- The system was able to handle the load without any issues, even upto 55k RPS.
- The system was able to deduplicate the data without any issues

### Lag
- Lag was directly proportional to the RPS and the amount of data sent at the given RPS. 
- For a given RPS, lag was increasing with the amount of data sent (expected)

### Resource Utilization
- CPU utilization was efficient across all test variants
- Memory usage remained stable during extended test runs


## Next Steps

1. **Further Testing**
   - Longer duration tests
   - Higher throughput scenarios   
   - Tests with different events data

2. **Batch Size Optimization**
   - Testing with different batch sizes to compare performance and lag

3. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Enhanced metrics collection 
   - Advanced analysis of the results

4. **Hardware setup**
    - Testing on different hardware 
    - Tests with remote clickhouse and kafka to check performance with network delay
