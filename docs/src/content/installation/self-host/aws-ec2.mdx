# GlassFlow on AWS EC2

This guide will walk you through the process of installing GlassFlow on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with enough permissions to create EC2 instances and security groups.

## Installation

1. Create a new EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

2. Update the instance's security group to allow inbound traffic on port `8080` (TCP).  
   > **Warning:** Opening port 8080 to the internet exposes the GlassFlow UI publicly. For production, restrict access by IP or use a VPN.

3. Log in to the instance and install Git and Docker:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras git
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

4. After adding your user to the Docker group, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect, or run:
```bash
newgrp docker
```

5. Install Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

6. Restart your terminal session and verify Docker and Docker Compose installation:
```bash
docker info
docker-compose version
```

7. Clone the GlassFlow repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glassflow/clickhouse-etl.git
```

8. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
cd clickhouse-etl
docker compose up -d
```

9. Access the GlassFlow UI by visiting:
```
http://<instance-public-ip>:8080
```
Replace `<instance-public-ip>` with your EC2 instance's public IPv4 address found in the AWS EC2 Console.
