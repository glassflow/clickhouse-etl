# Installation

GlassFlow is open source and can be self-hosted using Docker. This section contains guides for different deployment scenarios.

## Self-Hosting Options

### [Local Docker](/installation/self-host/local-docker)

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker on your local machine. This will give you a local environment that you can use to create a pipeline and test the functionality.

### [AWS EC2](/installation/self-host/aws-ec2)

To run GlassFlow in your AWS account, follow the guide for running GlassFlow on AWS EC2 with Docker. This is suitable for development and testing environments within your VPC.

### [Kubernetes with Helm](/installation/self-host/kubernetes-helm)

To run GlassFlow in your Kubernetes cluster, use the Helm chart. This provides a Kubernetes deployment for running GlassFlow.
