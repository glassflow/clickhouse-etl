# Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing data pipelines using GlassFlow. We'll cover everything from initial setup to monitoring your pipeline's performance.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your pipeline, ensure you have:

1. GlassFlow running locally (see [Installation Guide](/installation))
2. Access to your Kafka cluster
3. Access to your ClickHouse database
4. The following information ready:
   - Kafka connection details
   - ClickHouse connection details
   - Source topic names
   - Target table names

## Creating a Pipeline

### 1. Access the Web Interface

The glassflow web interface is available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Configure Source (Kafka)

1. **Connection Setup**
   - Enter your Kafka broker details
   - Provide authentication credentials if required
   - Test the connection

2. **Topic Selection**
   - Select the Kafka topic(s) you want to process
   - For joins, you'll need to select both left and right topics
   - Verify topic access and schema

### 3. Configure Transformations

#### Deduplication Setup
- Select the deduplication key field
- Set the time window for deduplication
- Configure any additional deduplication parameters

#### Join Configuration (Optional)
If you're joining multiple topics:
- Select the join type
- Configure join keys for both topics
- Set the join time window
- Choose the join orientation (left/right)

### 4. Configure Sink (ClickHouse)

1. **Connection Setup**
   - Enter your ClickHouse server details
   - Provide authentication credentials
   - Select the target database

2. **Table Configuration**
   - Select or create the target table
   - Map source fields to target columns
   - Configure data types and transformations

### 5. Field Mapping

The UI provides an intuitive interface for mapping fields:
- Drag and drop fields to map them
- Configure data type conversions
- Set default values if needed
- Preview the mapping results

## Deploying the Pipeline

### 1. Review Configuration
- Verify all settings
- Check field mappings
- Review transformation rules

### 2. Deploy
- Click the "Deploy" button
- The UI will generate the pipeline configuration. The structure of the conifguration can be found on the [Pipeline Configuration](/pipeline_configuration) page
- The configuration is sent to the GlassFlow API
- The pipeline starts processing data


## Verifying Data Flow

1. **Check Kafka Topics**
   - Verify data is being produced
   - Check message format
   - Monitor topic health

2. **Monitor ClickHouse**
   - Verify data arrival
   - Check data quality
   - Monitor table growth
   - Validate transformations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Connection problems
- Mapping errors
- Transformation failures
- Performance issues

### Getting Help
- Check the [Support Guide](/support)
- Review error messages
- Check system logs
- Contact support if needed
