# Installation

GlassFlow for ClickHouse Streaming ETL is designed to run locally using Docker and docker-compose. 
The github repository is shipped with a pre-configured docker-compose file that sets up all necessary components.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quick Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glassflow/clickhouse-etl.git
cd clickhouse-etl
```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` to configure the pipeline. For detailed instructions on setting up your first pipeline, see the [Usage Guide](/pipeline/usage).

For details about the Docker components that are running, see the [System Components](/architecture/system-components) page.

## Stopping the Services

To stop all services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop services and remove volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**
   - Ensure ports 8080 and 4222 are not in use by other applications
   - You can modify the ports in `docker-compose.yaml` if needed

2. **Container Startup Issues**
   - Check container logs: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
   - Ensure all required ports are accessible
   - Verify Docker has enough resources allocated

3. **UI Not Accessible**
   - Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Check Nginx logs: `docker-compose logs nginx`
   - Ensure you're accessing the correct URL: `http://localhost:8080`
