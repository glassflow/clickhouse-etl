# Release Notes v2.9.x

The 2.9.x series introduces **stateless transformations enabled by default** in the web UI and **revamped pipelines list and creation wizard**. This release focuses on improving the day-to-day experience of creating and managing pipelines, with clearer navigation and better validation.

## Version History

- **v2.9.2** — Patch release with bug fixes and default behavior updates
- **v2.9.1** — Patch release with filter and deduplication component fixes
- **v2.9.0** — Pipeline list and wizard revamp, transformations and filter improvements

## What's New

### 🔄 Stateless Transformations and Filters Enabled on the web UI

Stateless transformations and filters are now **enabled on the web UI** by default:

- **Filter step** — The filter step is now visible in the pipeline wizard
- **Transformation step** — The transformation step is now visible in the pipeline wizard

### 📋 Revamped Pipelines List

The pipelines list has been **redesigned** for a clearer overview and easier actions:

- **Cleaner layout** — Updated table and card presentation with consistent styling
- **Copy pipeline ID** — Quick copy of pipeline ID from the list
- **Status filtering** — Filter pipelines by status
- **Streamlined actions** — Simplified action buttons and navigation

### 🔧 Transformation Configurator Improvements

The transformation configurator has been **reworked** for clarity and flexibility:

- **Concatenation builder** — New builder for string concatenation expressions
- **Waterfall support** — Support for waterfall-style functions and a more capable complex expression builder
- **Raw expression mode** — Manual input and raw expression mode for advanced expressions
- **Expression mode fixes** — Correct handling of various functions and fractional values in expression mode
- **Error feedback** — Expandable panel to inspect transformation expression errors
- **Event editing** — Event modifications at the type verification step; modified schema can be used as the source of truth for downstream steps, including when a schema is already present

### 🔍 Filter Builder Revamp

The filter builder has been **improved** for reliability and flexibility:

- **Condition chaining** — Filter conditions chain correctly
- **Manual input** — Option to enter filter expressions manually

### 🗺️ Pipeline Configuration Upload

You can **upload a pipeline configuration** instead of building it step-by-step:

- **Upload option** — New option in the wizard to upload a pipeline JSON configuration file
- **Hydration** — Uploaded config is hydrated so the wizard reflects the full configuration
- **Validation** — Validation and error handling for uploaded configs

### 🗂️ Auto Mapping and Schema Handling

- **Auto mapping on demand** — Auto mapping can be triggered at the mapping step when needed
- **Type verification** — Event editing at the type verification step; modified schema is used as the source of truth for downstream steps

### 🆕 Patch Releases: v2.9.1 and v2.9.2

**v2.9.1**

- **Filter-only pipelines** — Kubernetes orchestrator now enables the deduplication component when only filtering is enabled (no deduplication), so filter-only pipelines run correctly

**v2.9.2**

- **Sink read path** — Fixed sink reading from the transform component when only filtering is enabled
- **Pipeline config generation** — Fixed pipeline config generation to correctly include transformation expressions
- **Event fetching** — Improved error display when reaching end-of-topic while fetching events
- **Config upload** — Fixed pipeline config upload failing silently after hydration
- **Field mapper** — Fixed search field alignment in the field mapper
- **Validation** — Improved validation for topic selection and deduplication, with clearer error messages and correct submit button state when valid
- **UI** — Styling changes to consolidate look and feel; new searchable select component (reused in transformation field select); fixed transformation select positioning; fixed help menu in light mode; ClickHouse mapper draft state preserved when revisiting the step; smart navigation with resume step and skipped event fetching when revisiting the Kafka selection form

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

- **No breaking changes** — This release is fully backward compatible
- **Transformations on by default** — If you relied on transformations being hidden, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSFORMATIONS_ENABLED=false` in your UI configuration
- **Filter-only pipelines** — Pipelines with only a filter (no deduplication) now correctly start the deduplication component; no config change needed

### Configuration Updates

- **Transformations** — Default for `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSFORMATIONS_ENABLED` is now `true` in the UI
- **Helm and build** — No new required Helm values; build and image options updated for multi-arch and standalone output

## Try It Out

To try the new features in v2.9.x:

1. **Deploy the latest version** using our [Kubernetes Helm charts](/installation/kubernetes)
2. **Create a pipeline with transformations** — Use the transformation configurator in the wizard (enabled by default)
3. **Use the revamped pipelines list** — Filter by status, copy pipeline IDs, and use the new actions
4. **Upload a config** — Upload an existing pipeline JSON from the creation flow
