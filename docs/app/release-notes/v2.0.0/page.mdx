# Release Notes Highlights v2.0.0

Version 2 is the biggest release in GlassFlowâ€™s history. With **282 commits**, this release takes GlassFlow from an early adopter tool to a **production-ready Streaming ETL**.

Our focus has been on making GlassFlow robust, secure, and more scalable for real-world data pipelines while delivering new functionalities.

## What are the changes?

### Kafka Connectivity

GlassFlow now connects to **enterprise Kafka clusters** with **TLS and SASL_SSL support**. This means you can finally run GlassFlow in the same secure environments your company already trusts. In addition, you have the option to **skip certificate checks** for fast dev/test setups.

### Full Kubernetes Support:

We now provide **Helm charts** for deploying GlassFlow on Kubernetes. This makes running in production straightforward and with **multi-architecture images (AMD64 + ARM64)** you can run the same setup in the cloud and on-prem.

Our **Kubernetes Operator** monitors your cluster for events and automatically creates the resources required for GlassFlow. It keeps your pipelines running by handling updates and scaling.

```bash
helm repo add glassflow https://glassflow.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install glassflow glassflow/glassflow-etl
```

### Cloud-native Architecture:

GlassFlow has been redesigned to be **horizontally scalable**. As your data grows, you can scale pipelines without rethinking your architecture and the microservices-based design fits naturally into modern distributed environments.

### Better Observability:

We have embedded **pipeline metrics and improved logging,** so you can gain deeper insights into pipeline health and performance, making debugging and monitoring much easier.

With the **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** Fault events at ingestion will be logged to the [DLQ](https://docs.glassflow.dev/pipeline/usage/python-sdk#read-messages-from-pipelines-dead-letter-queue-dlq) without blocking your current pipeline. Giving you the chance to re-run those events and have your ClickHouse complete.

### Real-World Data Handling:

Glasflow is now supporting **Nested JSON.** It allows you to seamlessly ingest, flatten and process complex Kafka event payloads that mirror messy real-world data. Feel free to check out our example [here](https://docs.glassflow.dev/pipeline/data-format#nested-json-support).

**Supporting Low-cardinality data types** is crucial for storing and querying data more efficiently, improving performance and reducing costs on your ClickHouse. That's why we wanted to include this functionality in our release.

### Better Usability:

Our teams made several improvements to make it easier for you to manage your pipelines. Those improvements start with the ability to **pause and resume** pipelines via our UI and our SDK.

With this version we enabled to run multiple pipelines within GlassFlow.

## Now, it is demo time!

To give you a better understanding of the GlassFlows version 2 power, we have prepared a demo.

In this demo, you will see:

- A setup of GlassFlow via Kubernetes helm-charts running on GCP
- Ingesting messages via a SASL Kafka setup
- Deduplication of a Kafka stream within a 1-minute time window
- Mapping of events data to ClickHouse fields
- Quick overview of dead-letter-queue
