# Release Notes v2.1.4

Version 2.1.4 brings significant improvements to observability, data type support, and user experience. This release focuses on making GlassFlow more production-ready with enhanced monitoring capabilities and better data handling.

## What's New

### üîç Enhanced Observability with OpenTelemetry

GlassFlow now includes comprehensive **OpenTelemetry (OTEL) integration** for better observability and monitoring of your data pipelines. This enterprise-grade observability solution provides:

- **Separate toggles** for OTEL logs and metrics, giving you granular control over what data is collected
- **Pipeline-level metrics** including:
  - Total number of records read from Kafka
  - Records processed per second
  - Total records written to Dead Letter Queue
  - Total records written to ClickHouse
  - Records written to ClickHouse per second
  - Message processing time within components
- **Service instance identification** for horizontally scaled replicas, enabling pod-level metrics
- **Structured logging** with context-aware error handling and improved log formatting

> üí° **Setup Guide**: For detailed OTEL configuration and setup instructions, see our [Observability Setup Guide](/observability/setup) (coming soon).

### üó∫Ô∏è Map Data Type Support

GlassFlow now supports **Map data types** for handling key-value pair data structures:

- **Map(String, String)** - For simple key-value pairs
- **Array(Map(String, String))** - For arrays of maps
- **Automatic type conversion** - Map values are automatically converted to strings for ClickHouse compatibility
- **Nested JSON support** - Maps work seamlessly with nested JSON structures using dot notation

This enhancement allows you to handle more complex data structures commonly found in real-world applications.

### üé® UI Improvements

The user interface has been significantly enhanced with better visibility into pipeline performance:

#### ClickHouse Statistics Integration
- **Real-time ClickHouse table stats** directly on the pipeline detail page
- **Performance metrics** showing table size, row counts, and query performance
- **Better resource monitoring** with component-level statistics

#### Enhanced Pipeline Management
- **Updated pipeline list page** with more detailed information
- **Download pipeline configuration** button for easy backup and sharing
- **Improved pipeline details** with better organization and readability

### üõ°Ô∏è Better Null Value Handling

GlassFlow now provides **improved null value handling** throughout the data pipeline:

- **Graceful null processing** - Null values are handled without breaking the pipeline
- **Dead Letter Queue integration** - Faulty records with null issues are properly routed to DLQ
- **Type-safe conversions** - Better validation and conversion of null values across different data types

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- **No breaking changes** - This release is fully backward compatible
- **OTEL is optional** - Existing pipelines will continue to work without OTEL configuration
- **Map types available** - You can now use Map data types in new pipeline configurations

### Configuration Updates
- **Environment variables** - Service name and version are now read from environment variables for OTEL
- **Pipeline configuration** - Map data types can be used in field definitions and table mappings
