## What's New in v2.6.x

### 🔄 Stateless Transformations

GlassFlow now supports **stateless transformations** that allow you to reshape event payloads on the fly using expression-based mappings:

- **Expression-based transformations** - Use the `expr` language to define transformations that operate on each event independently
- **Rich helper functions** - Built-in functions for parsing URLs, user agents, timestamps, and more
- **Type-safe conversions** - Automatic type conversion to ensure data integrity
- **Flexible field derivation** - Create new fields from existing ones, normalize data, and reshape JSON structures
- **Integration with deduplication** - Stateless transformations work seamlessly with deduplication pipelines

Stateless transformations are called "stateless" because each event is transformed independently without relying on any stored state or history. This makes them perfect for:

- Normalizing fields (e.g., parsing URLs, user agents, or timestamps)
- Deriving new fields from existing ones
- Cleaning up or reformatting data before it lands in ClickHouse

> ⚠️ **Note**: In v2.6.x, stateless transformations are only supported via the **backend API or Python SDK**. The web UI does not support creating or editing pipelines with stateless transformations in this version. To use stateless transformations, you must create pipelines programmatically using the API or SDK.

> 💡 **Learn More**: For detailed information on configuring stateless transformations, see the [Stateless Transformations](/configuration/transformations/stateless-transformation) documentation.

### 🔍 Enhanced Filtering System

The filtering system has been significantly improved with better UI integration and functionality:

- **Pipeline-level filters** - Filters are now configured at the pipeline level, making them easier to manage
- **Complex query builder** - Enhanced filter expression builder with support for arithmetic operations
- **Filter hydration improvements** - Better handling of filter state during pipeline creation and editing
- **View and edit modes** - Proper support for viewing and editing filters in existing pipelines
- **Filter form improvements** - Better wording, validation, and handling of unmapped filter fields
- **Feature flag support** - Filters can be enabled/disabled via feature flags

Filters are applied at the ingestor stage, before any other processing, ensuring efficient early filtering of events.

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

The user interface has been refreshed with improved styling and better component consistency:

- **Revamped styling** - Consolidated CSS, removed layered styles, and aligned components with design system
- **Light theme support** - Better support for light theme with semantic color values
- **Improved form controls** - Better styling for inputs, selects, and form controls with proper hover states
- **Enhanced modals** - Improved modal styling and border handling
- **Better card components** - Updated card styling throughout the application
- **Fixed context menus** - Improved table context menus with proper border styles
- **Responsive improvements** - Better scaling and responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### 🔒 Security Updates

- **Next.js security patches** - Upgraded to Next.js 16.0.7 for security reasons
- **React security patches** - Updated React to bring security patches
- **Dependency updates** - Various dependency updates for security and stability

## Configuration Changes

### New Pipeline Configuration

Stateless transformations are configured in the pipeline JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "stateless_transformation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "id": "my-stateless-transformation",
    "type": "expr_lang_transform",
    "config": {
      "transform": [
        {
          "expression": "upper(status)",
          "output_name": "status_normalized",
          "output_type": "string"
        },
        {
          "expression": "parseUserAgent(user_agent, 'device')",
          "output_name": "device_type",
          "output_type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Filter Configuration

Filters are now configured at the pipeline level:

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "expression": "age > 18 and status == 'active'"
  }
}
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

- **No breaking changes** - These releases are fully backward compatible
- **Stateless transformations optional** - Stateless transformations are optional and disabled by default
- **Filter improvements** - Existing filters will continue to work, with improved UI and functionality
- **UI updates** - The UI has been refreshed but maintains the same functionality

### Configuration Updates

- **Stateless transformation config** - New optional `stateless_transformation` section in pipeline JSON
- **Filter location** - Filters remain at the pipeline level but with improved configuration options
- **Schema format** - Pipeline schema format remains compatible with v2.5.x

## Try It Out

To experience the new features in v2.6.x:

1. **Deploy the latest version** using our [Kubernetes Helm charts](/installation/kubernetes)
2. **Create stateless transformations** - Use the API or Python SDK to create pipelines with expression-based mappings to reshape your event data (UI support coming in a future release)
3. **Explore the enhanced filters** - Use the improved filter UI to create complex filter expressions
4. **Check out the refreshed UI** - Experience the improved styling and component consistency
5. **Review the documentation** - See the [Stateless Transformations](/configuration/transformations/stateless-transformation) guide for examples and the [Python SDK](/usage-guide/python-sdk) documentation for programmatic pipeline creation
