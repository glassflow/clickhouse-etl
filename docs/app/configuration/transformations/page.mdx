# Transformations

GlassFlow supports several transformations that can be applied to your data as it flows through the pipeline. Transformations allow you to process, filter, and combine data before it reaches the final destination in ClickHouse.

## Available Transformations

### [Deduplication](/usage-guide/transformations/deduplication)

The **Deduplication** transformation removes duplicate events from your data stream based on a unique identifier field. This is essential for ensuring data quality and preventing duplicate records in your ClickHouse tables.

**Key Features:**
- Removes duplicate events based on a configurable ID field
- Uses a time window to determine duplicate detection scope
- Ensures exactly-once semantics through atomic transactions
- Prevents duplicate output even during processing failures

### [Join](/usage-guide/transformations/join)

The **Join** transformation combines data from multiple Kafka topics based on join keys and time windows. This enables you to enrich your data by merging related events from different sources.

**Key Features:**
- Temporal join algorithm for time-based matching
- Supports left and right join orientations
- Configurable time windows for matching events
- Automatic cleanup of matched entries

### [Filter](/usage-guide/transformations/filter)

The **Filter** transformation allows you to selectively process events based on configurable expressions. Events that match the filter expression are processed, while non-matching events are filtered out.

**Key Features:**
- Expression-based filtering using field values
- Supports complex logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Evaluates filters at the ingestor stage
- Filtered events are not processed further in the pipeline

## Transformation Order

Transformations are applied in the following order within a pipeline:

1. **Filter** - Applied at the ingestor stage, before any other processing
2. **Deduplication** - Applied after ingestion, before joining
3. **Join** - Applied after deduplication, before sinking to ClickHouse

This order ensures that:
- Filtering happens early, reducing processing overhead
- Deduplication works on clean, filtered data
- Joins operate on deduplicated streams

## Combining Transformations

You can combine multiple transformations in a single pipeline:

- **Filter + Deduplication**: Filter events first, then deduplicate the filtered results
- **Filter + Join**: Filter events from multiple topics, then join them
- **Deduplication + Join**: Deduplicate events, then join deduplicated streams
- **All Three**: Apply filter, then deduplication, then join

## Configuration

Each transformation is configured in the pipeline JSON configuration. For detailed configuration options, see the [Pipeline JSON Reference](/configuration/pipeline-json-reference) documentation.

## Data Flow

Transformations are applied as data flows through the pipeline stages. For a detailed explanation of how data flows through transformations, see the [Data Flow](/architecture/data-flow) documentation.
