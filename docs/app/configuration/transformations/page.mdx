# Transformations

GlassFlow supports several transformations that can be applied to your data as it flows through the pipeline. Transformations allow you to process, filter, and combine data before it reaches the final destination in ClickHouse.

## Available Transformations

- [**Deduplication**](/configuration/transformations/deduplication) - Remove duplicate events from your data stream based on a unique identifier field
- [**Join**](/configuration/transformations/join) - Combine data from multiple Kafka topics based on join keys and time windows
- [**Filter**](/configuration/transformations/filter) - Selectively process events based on configurable expressions

## Transformation Order

Transformations are applied in the following order within a pipeline:

1. **Filter** - Applied at the ingestor stage, before any other processing
2. **Deduplication** - Applied after ingestion, before joining
3. **Join** - Applied after deduplication, before sinking to ClickHouse

This order ensures that:
- Filtering happens early, reducing processing overhead
- Deduplication works on clean, filtered data
- Joins operate on deduplicated streams
