# GlassFlow for ClickHouse ETL Documentation


GlassFlow is an open-source streaming ETL for Kafka to Clickhouse streams. It has built-in deduplication, temporal joins, handles late-arriving events with exactly-once guarantees, and scales for high-throughput low-latency workloads on ClickHouse. It reduces the need to use ReplacingMergeTree, FINAL and Joins on ClickHouse.
