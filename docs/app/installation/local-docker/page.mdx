# GlassFlow on Docker

GlassFlow is designed to run locally using Docker and docker-compose. 
The GitHub repository is shipped with a pre-configured docker-compose file that sets up all necessary components.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quick Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glassflow/clickhouse-etl.git
cd clickhouse-etl
```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```

3. Follow the logs in real-time for all containers:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Verify the Installation

1. Ensure that your containers are running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:
```bash
docker compose ps
```
The output should look like this:

```bash

```

For details about the Docker components that are running, see the [System Components](/architecture/system-components) page.

2. Verify that the web interface is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. In case you do not see the web interface, 
please ensure that the containers are in running state and no other services are using the port 8080. If needed, you can modify the ports in `docker-compose.yaml` file.                                                                                                    

## Creating a Pipeline

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` to configure the pipeline. 
For detailed instructions on setting up your first pipeline, see the [Usage Guide](/pipeline/usage).

## Stopping the Services

To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop services and remove volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**
   - Ensure ports 8080 and 4222 are not in use by other applications
   - You can modify the ports in `docker-compose.yaml` if needed

2. **Container Startup Issues**
   - Check container logs: `docker compose logs [service-name]` 
      - `docker compose logs app` for the backend app 
      - `docker compose logs ui` for the UI
   - Ensure all required ports are accessible
   - Verify Docker has enough resources allocated

3. **UI Not Accessible**
   - Verify all containers are running: `docker compose ps`
   - Check Nginx logs: `docker compose logs nginx`
   - Ensure you're accessing the correct URL: `http://localhost:8080`
