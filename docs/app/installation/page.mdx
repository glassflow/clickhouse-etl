# Installation

GlassFlow is open source and can be self-hosted on Kubernetes. GlassFlow works with managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, and more.
You can also run GlassFlow on your own Kubernetes cluster. 
For local testing or a small POC, you can also use Docker and Docker Compose to run GlassFlow on your local machine.

## Self-Hosting Options

### [Kubernetes with Helm](/installation/kubernetes-helm)

To run GlassFlow in your Kubernetes cluster, use the Helm chart. This provides a Kubernetes deployment for running GlassFlow.

### [Local Docker](/installation/local-docker)

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker on your local machine. This will give you a local environment that you can use to create a pipeline and test the functionality.

### [AWS EC2](/installation/aws-ec2)

To run a small docer based instance of GlassFlow in your AWS account, follow the guide for running GlassFlow on AWS EC2 with Docker. This is suitable for development and testing environments within your VPC.
