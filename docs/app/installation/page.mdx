# Installation

GlassFlow is open source and can be self-hosted on Kubernetes. GlassFlow works with managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, and more.
You can also run GlassFlow on your own Kubernetes cluster.

For local testing and development, you can use the GlassFlow CLI to quickly set up a local environment.

## Self-Hosting Options

### [CLI (Local Development)](/installation/cli)

The GlassFlow CLI provides a quick way to set up a local development environment for exploring and testing GlassFlow. It creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind and deploys all necessary components.

### [Kubernetes](/installation/kubernetes)

To run GlassFlow in your Kubernetes cluster, use the Helm chart. This provides a Kubernetes deployment for running GlassFlow in production.
