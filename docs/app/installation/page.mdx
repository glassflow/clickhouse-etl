# Installation

GlassFlow is open source and can be self-hosted on Kubernetes. GlassFlow works with managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, and more.
You can also run GlassFlow on your own Kubernetes cluster. 
For local testing or a small POC, you can also use Docker and Docker Compose to run GlassFlow on your local machine.

## Self-Hosting Options

### [Kubernetes](/installation/kubernetes)

To run GlassFlow in your Kubernetes cluster, use the Helm chart. This provides a Kubernetes deployment for running GlassFlow.

### [Docker](/installation/docker)

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker on your local machine. This will give you a local environment that you can use to create a pipeline and test the functionality.
