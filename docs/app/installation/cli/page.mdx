# GlassFlow CLI Installation

The GlassFlow CLI provides a quick way to set up a local development environment for exploring and testing GlassFlow - an open-source ETL tool for real-time data processing from Kafka to ClickHouse.

<Callout type="warning">
- The GlassFlow CLI is designed for **local testing, demos, and exploration only**.
- For production deployments, use the official [GlassFlow Helm charts](/installation/kubernetes).
- The CLI creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind and deploys all necessary components.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before installing the GlassFlow CLI, ensure you have:

- **Docker** (or compatible runtime like Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Colima, or Podman)
- **kubectl** (installed automatically via Homebrew, or install manually)

## Installation

<Steps>
### Install via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap glassflow/tap
brew install glassflow
```

This will automatically install `kubectl` if it's not already installed on your system.

### Install from GitHub Releases

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can download the latest release for your platform from the [GlassFlow CLI GitHub Releases](https://github.com/glassflow/cli/releases).

1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture
2. Extract the binary and add it to your PATH
3. Make the binary executable (on Unix-like systems):
   ```bash
   chmod +x glassflow
   ```

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify that the CLI is working correctly:

```bash
glassflow version
```

You should see the version number of the installed GlassFlow CLI.

</Steps>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
### Start the Local Environment

To start the local development environment with a demo setup:

```bash
glassflow up --demo
```

This command will:
- Create a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind
- Install Kafka, ClickHouse, and GlassFlow using Helm charts
- Set up a demo pipeline with sample data
- Configure port forwarding for UI and API access

### Access GlassFlow Services

Once the environment is running, you can access:

- **GlassFlow UI**: [http://localhost:30080](http://localhost:30080)
- **GlassFlow API**: [http://localhost:30180](http://localhost:30180)
- **ClickHouse HTTP**: [http://localhost:30090](http://localhost:30090)

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
The demo environment comes pre-configured with a pipeline that ingests events from the `demo_events` Kafka topic into the `demo_events` table in ClickHouse. You can view this pipeline in the GlassFlow UI.
</Callout>

### Stop the Environment

When you're done testing, stop and clean up the local environment:

```bash
glassflow down
```

This will:
- Stop all running services
- Remove the Kind cluster
- Clean up all resources

</Steps>

## What Gets Installed

When you run `glassflow up --demo`, the CLI installs the following components:

- **Kind**: Local Kubernetes cluster for running all services
- **Kafka**: Message broker (Bitnami Helm chart) for streaming data
- **ClickHouse**: Columnar database (Bitnami Helm chart) for data storage
- **GlassFlow ETL**: Real-time streaming ETL service (GlassFlow Helm chart)
- **Demo Pipeline**: Pre-configured pipeline with sample data for testing
