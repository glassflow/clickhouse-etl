# Pipeline

GlassFlow pipelines are the core of the platform, enabling real-time data processing from Kafka to ClickHouse.

## What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline in GlassFlow is a configuration that defines:

- **Source**: Kafka topics to consume from
- **Transformations**: Data processing steps (deduplication, joins, etc.)
- **Sink**: ClickHouse tables to write to
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics


## Creating Pipelines

GlassFlow provides two ways to create pipelines:

### [Web UI](/pipeline/usage/web-ui)

Visual wizard for creating pipelines through the web interface.

### [Python SDK](/pipeline/usage/python-sdk)

Programmatic pipeline creation using the Python SDK.
