GlassFlow consists of the following components running as Docker containers:

## Docker Containers

### 1. NATS Server
- **Docker Image**: `nats:alpine`
- **Purpose**: Used as persistance KV storage and as the message broker for internal communication between components
- Features:
  - JetStream enabled for persistent messaging
  - High-performance message delivery
  - Automatic restart capabilities

### 2. Frontend UI
- **Docker Image**: `ghcr.io/glassflow/glassflow-etl-fe:stable`
- **Purpose**: Web-based user interface for pipeline management
- Features:
  - Intuitive pipeline configuration
  - Real-time monitoring
  - User-friendly interface for managing data operations

### 3. Backend Application
- **Docker Image**: `ghcr.io/glassflow/glassflow-etl-be:stable`
- **Purpose**: Core ETL engine that provides an API and orchestrates the pipeline
- Features:
  - Handles pipeline orchestration
  - Manages data processing
  - Runs ETL components: Deduplication, Join, ClickHouse sink
  - Maintains persistent logs

### 4. Nginx
- **Docker Image**: `nginx:1.27-alpine`
- **Purpose**: Serves as a reverse proxy
- Features:
  - Routes traffic to frontend and backend services
  - Serves static files
  - Handles load balancing

## Volumes

The setup uses the following Docker volumes:

- `logs`: Stores application logs for persistence

## Environment Variables

The backend service uses the following environment variables:

- `GLASSFLOW_LOG_FILE_PATH`: Path for log files (`/tmp/logs/glassflow`)
- `GLASSFLOW_NATS_SERVER`: NATS server address (`nats:4222`)
