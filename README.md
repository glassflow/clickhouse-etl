# GlassFlow for ClickHouse Streaming ETL

GlassFlow is an open-source ETL tool that enables real-time data processing from Kafka to ClickHouse. GlassFlow pipelines can perform the following operations:

- **Deduplicate**: Remove duplicate records based on configurable keys and time windows - use when you need to ensure data uniqueness
- **Join**: Perform temporal joins between multiple Kafka topics - use when combining related data streams with time-based matching
- **Deduplicate & Join**: Combine both deduplication and joining in a single pipeline
- **Ingest only**: Direct data transfer from Kafka to ClickHouse without transformations

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start
This guide walks you through a **local installation using Docker Compose** ‚Äî perfect for development, testing, or trying out GlassFlow on your machine.

Explore more demos and building pipeline via UI in our [docs](https://docs.glassflow.dev/getting-started/demo). To start creating your own pipelines, follow the [Usage Guide](https://docs.glassflow.dev/usage-guide)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glassflow/clickhouse-etl.git
cd clickhouse-etl
```
1. Go to the demo folder and start the services

```bash
cd demos
docker compose up -d
```
This will start GlassFlow, Kafka and Clickhouse inside of docker. 

3. Once the services are up, run the demo script which will create a topic in kafka, a table in clickhouse and setup a pipeline on glassflow. 
Since the script is in python, you will need python installed with the needed dependencies. 

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
```bash
python demo_deduplication.py --num-records 10000 --duplication-rate 0.1
```
This will send 10000 records to the kafka topic (with 10% duplicates). 

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` to view the demo pipeline.

5. View the logs:
```bash
# Follow logs in real-time for all containers
docker compose logs -f

# logs for the backend api
docker compose logs api -f

# logs for the UI
docker compose logs ui -f
```


## üß≠ Installation Options

GlassFlow is open source and can be self-hosted on Kubernetes. GlassFlow works with any managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, and more.
For local testing or a small POC, you can also use Docker and Docker Compose to run GlassFlow on your local machine.
