## Styling Rules

- **Primitives own styling:** Components in `components/ui/*` own all visual states. Consumers pass semantic props only (`variant`, `error`, `disabled`, `readOnly`); use `className` for layout only. See `.cursor/architecture/UI_AND_STYLING.md`.

- **Theme**: Dark-only. Do not add light theme variants unless explicitly required.

- **Token and design system**: Token truth lives in `docs/architecture/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Do not add or assume tokens that are not defined there. Prefer semantic tokens; no hardcoded colors; card variants must follow the design system.
  - Do: use `var(--surface-bg)`, `var(--control-border)`, and other semantic tokens from the design system.
  - Don't: use raw hex or Tailwind color classes (e.g. `bg-gray-800`) for brand or semantic colors.

- **Tokens**: Use semantic tokens from theme CSS; avoid hardcoded colors. If a new color is needed, add it in the design system and reference from theme; do not invent tokens in components.

- **Tailwind**: Use Tailwind for layout, spacing, typography. Keep class lists concise; avoid deeply nested utility chains.

- **Base components**: `components/ui/*` should remain theme-compliant; avoid per-component hardcoded colors.

- **Global CSS**: Place shared styles in `src/app/globals.css` or `src/app/styles/*`; avoid scattering ad-hoc styles in components.

- **Responsiveness**: Use Tailwind responsive utilities; test key breakpoints.

- **Animations/Transitions**: Keep subtle; prefer CSS utilities defined under `styles/animations.css` when possible.

- **Consistency**: Reuse spacing/typography scale; avoid one-off sizes unless justified.
