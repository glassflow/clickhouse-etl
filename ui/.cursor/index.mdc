## General Development Rules

- Prefer server components; add `'use client'` only when hooks/DOM APIs are needed.
- Follow TypeScript strictness; avoid `any`; infer types from Zod schemas where possible.
- Keep components small and composable; separate containers (logic) from presenters (UI).
- Use feature modules for domain logic; keep shared pieces in `components/common` or `components/shared`.
- Forms are schema-first (Zod) and config-driven; managers handle logic, renderers handle UI.
- State changes go through Zustand slice actions; respect mode (create/edit/view) and read-only states.
- API interactions go through client API helpers → Next.js `/ui-api` routes → backend; keep routes thin.
- Styling: use Tailwind + theme tokens; dark theme only; avoid hardcoded colors.
