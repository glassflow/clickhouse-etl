## Component Rules

- **Hierarchy**: Use layers consistently:
  - `components/ui/`: shadcn/radix primitives. Do not customize behaviors; only extend when aligning with upstream updates.
  - `components/common/`: reusable, domain-neutral patterns used in 2+ places.
  - `components/shared/`: app-wide/shared with light domain context (layout, providers).
  - `modules/*/components/`: feature-specific components with domain logic.

- **Structure**: Prefer Container → Presenter. Containers handle data/state/effects; presenters render UI.

- **Forms**: Use Manager → Renderer split. Manager owns `useForm` + submit; Renderer renders fields.

- **Client Boundary**: Add `'use client'` only when React hooks/DOM APIs are required.

- **Props**:
  - Define `ComponentNameProps`; keep props minimal and typed.
  - Prefer controlled components for form inputs.

- **Naming**: PascalCase files/components; keep directories kebab/lowercase where applicable.

- **Composition**:
  - Extract reusable pieces to `common/` before duplicating.
  - Keep side effects and store access out of presentational components.

- **Styling**:
  - Use Tailwind for layout/spacing/typography.
  - Use theme tokens; avoid hardcoded colors.

- **Imports**: External libs first, then internal aliases, then relative.
